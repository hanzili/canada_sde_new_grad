<p>The Finance Team is a diverse group of skilled individuals who are passionate about accounting and operations.

<p>This is a remote opportunity within Canada. This position will be for 4 months - May to August 2026.</p>
<p><strong>What you can expect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assist in the preparation of documentation for audits and other compliance needs</li>

<li>Support other ad hoc projects from various internal teams</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we're looking for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Confidence: A willingness to take on new challenges, and see them through to completion.</li>

<li>Curiosity: You look for better ways of doing things, even if everyone seems happy with how they are.</li>
<li>Teamwork: We work together, and succeed as a team!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonus points for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intermediate skills in Excel and Google Sheets</li>
<li>Good customer service skills</li>
<li>Keen interest in technology and software tools</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll be part of a team that challenges the status quo, and is excited to experiment and iterate in search of the best solution. That said, <em>1Password is not for everyone</em>. Our work is demanding, we strive for excellence, and the pace is fast. We need people who are keen to take on challenging problems, who seek feedback to grow, and who are driven to make an impact. If you're looking for a place where you can settle into a comfortable routine, this might not be the right fit for you. We’re looking for individuals who are proven experts in their fields, as well as those who are highly adaptable, can thrive in ambiguity and through change, are curious, and above all deliver results.  </p>
