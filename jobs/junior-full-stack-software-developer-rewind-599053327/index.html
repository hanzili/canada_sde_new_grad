Rewind backs up the cloud for over 20,000 businesses — protecting billions of items across multiple platforms. As a
**Full Stack Software Developer**
, you’ll help us build secure, scalable, and high-performing systems that businesses rely on to protect their data and stay resilient.
  
  
You’ll join a small, cross-functional team (4–7 people) that collaborates closely to design, build, and ship new product features. We’re looking for someone who thrives on solving complex problems, is driven by data and performance, and isn’t afraid to think critically or push boundaries.
  
  
At Rewind, leveraging
**AI tools to accelerate development and innovation**
is encouraged and valued. We want developers who are curious about how emerging technologies can make their work sharper, faster, and more impactful.
  
  
**What You’ll Do**
**End-to-end product development**</p><p>- Design, build, test, and maintain scalable back-end systems for our cloud backup services.
- Enhance and optimize front-end interfaces using React to improve performance and user experience.
- Contribute to technical design discussions, code reviews, and feature planning sessions.</p><p>**Quality, reliability &amp; performance**</p><p>- Write clean, testable, and maintainable code using modern frameworks and best practices.
- Improve product reliability and scalability through thoughtful engineering and automation.
- Participate in our R&amp;D on-call rotation to ensure smooth operations and quick incident response.</p><p>**Continuous improvement &amp; collaboration**</p><p>- Work closely with other developers, designers, and product managers to deliver features that matter.
- Proactively identify opportunities to streamline our development and deployment processes.
- Share insights on how AI-assisted tools can drive speed, accuracy, and innovation within the team.</p><p>**What You’ll Bring**</p><p>- You have co-op/internship experience as a Software Developer using Ruby on Rails, including libraries such as RSpec.
- Proficiency with React (or a comparable modern front-end framework).
- Familiarity with REST APIs, Git, and working in a Linux environment.
- Working knowledge of relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Strong problem-solving skills and a data-informed approach to decision making.
- Curiosity and adaptability — you’re comfortable learning and applying new tools, including AI-powered ones.
- A collaborative mindset that puts the customer first and values reliability and simplicity.</p><p>**Nice to have**</p><p>- Experience with GraphQL.
- Familiarity with TypeScript or JavaScript beyond React.
- Exposure to AWS, GCP, or Azure cloud environments.
- Interest in improving CI/CD pipelines or building internal tools that boost developer efficiency.</p><p>**Location and working hours**
This role is
**remote across Canada**
, with a
**preference for candidates working in Eastern Time (EST), ideally in Toronto and Ottawa**
.
  
  
**Salary range**
~ $85,000 - $95,000
  
  
**Compensation Philosophy**
The actual base salary will vary based on various factors, including market and individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process. The listed range above is a guideline, and the base salary range for this role may be modified.
  
  
If your expectations are above this range, it may be because your experience aligns with a more senior level. In some cases, we’re open to hiring at a higher level for the right person and are committed to paying competitively and fairly.
  
  
If your experience is closer to an earlier career stage, we may still consider your application. In that case, we would evaluate the role at a different level within our levelling framework, which would correspond to a salary below the range shown.
  
  
Pay is just one part of the overall compensation at Rewind.
  
  
**Why join Rewind**
At Rewind, you’ll help shape the future of data protection for thousands of businesses. We’re performance-driven, innovative, and not afraid to challenge what’s possible. You’ll join a team that values trust, accountability, and respect for people’s time — and encourages every employee to experiment, think critically, and grow.
  
  
We support innovation through experimentation — including smart use of AI tools — and believe the best ideas come from those who aren’t afraid to push boundaries.
