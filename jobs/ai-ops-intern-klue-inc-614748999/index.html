        <h2>Full Description</h2>
        <div class="description-content" itemprop="description">
            <p># **At** **Klue****, We’re Building the Future of Competitive Intelligence**</p><p>The **AI Ops Intern** supports the day-to-day work of the AI Ops team and is encouraged to think like a builder. You won’t just complete tasks; you’ll spot opportunities, suggest improvements, and take initiative to build small automations that move the business forward. This role is designed for someone who wants to *try things*, experiment, and learn by doing. This is a fixed term position from May - August 2026 and is open to Co-Op program students or recent graduates.</p><p>You’ll partner closely with the AI Ops team, cross-functional stakeholders, and internal “agent owners” to build simple but meaningful automations, run experiments, document workflows, and contribute to the operational backbone of our AI transformation.</p><p>This is a role for someone who’s **entrepreneurial, proactive, curious, and excited to take risks in a safe environment**. You’ll learn how AI systems operate in a real SaaS environment while independently owning pieces of work that actually ship.</p><p>## **What’s In It for You?**</p><p>You’ll get exposure to:</p><p>- Real AI workflows and the opportunity to use agent-building tools in a real-world environment
- Operations at scale across GTM, EPD, G&amp;A
- Automation design, prompt engineering, testing, and QA
- How to work cross-functionally and gather requirements
- Documenting and improving systems used across the company</p><p>If you excel in this role, future growth opportunities are an **AI Ops Specialist** or eventually a **GTM AI Ops Manager or Engineer** down the road.</p><p>## **What You’ll Do**</p><p>- **AI Workflow Development:** Own clearly scoped automation initiatives from start to finish. You’ll translate loosely defined problem statements into effective agents, prompts, and workflows, experimenting with different build approaches and iterating quickly. From drafting and testing to refining and shipping, you’ll take responsibility for delivering small components end-to-end while learning from what doesn’t work.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Help drive projects forward by being proactive, prepared, and solutions-oriented. You’ll participate in requirement-gathering sessions, independently follow up on open questions, and clearly communicate progress, blockers, and ideas. You’ll look for opportunities to support stakeholders beyond the original scope and assist with testing or data collection without waiting to be asked.
- **Operational Excellence &amp; Quality Assurance:** Ensure our automations work reliably by owning quality, not just task completion. You’ll design and run test cases independently, flag inconsistencies, investigate root causes, and suggest improvements. You’ll also take initiative to streamline existing workflows, balancing speed with thoughtful execution and knowing when accuracy matters most.
- **Documentation &amp; Knowledge Management:** Create clarity by documenting and improving how work gets done. You’ll document new workflows and known issues in a way others can immediately use, identify gaps in playbooks and proactively update them. You’ll capture edge cases, propose fixes, and apply an entrepreneurial mindset to knowledge sharing, making confusing processes clearer for everyone who follows.</p><p>## **What Success Looks Like**</p><p>We want you to love the role you are in and believe these skills and experiences will help you to be successful! We are looking for someone who:</p><p>- Tries new approaches, experiments with ideas, and learns quickly from what doesn’t work.
- Completes assigned tasks accurately and on time, and proactively seeks out the next problem to solve.
- Documentation is clear, structured, and easy to follow so others can maintain what you’ve built,
- Communicates progress proactively and clearly, especially when working independently.
- Asks thoughtful, clarifying questions up front and then runs independently.
- Demonstrates growing confidence in AI tools and workflows by taking on slightly harder challenges over time.
- Contributes to smooth collaboration across teams by stepping in where needed and owning small pieces of work end‑to‑end..</p><p>## **What You Bring**</p><p>**Must Haves:**</p><p>- **AI Forward:** You’re always asking yourself: how could we do this with AI, and you have personal examples to prove it. Specifically, you have Prompt Engineering or basic scripting experience
- **Business Mindset:** You’ve got a mindset for growing businesses, and can speak and think about things from a business point of view
- **Systems Thinking:** You can see the big picture. You understand that changing one step in a data pipeline affects everything downstream. You don&#x27;t just fix the symptom; you look for the root cause.
- **Technical Curiosity:** You have a hunger to learn. You don&#x27;t know everything yet, and that&#x27;s okay, but you are willing to dive into new tools, error messages, and figure things out on the fly.
- **Attention to Detail:** You&#x27;re good at spotting the small stuff and catch errors and inconsistencies early
- **Solution-Oriented:** You don&#x27;t just report problems; you bring potential fixes (or at least hypotheses) to the table.
- **Resilience (Safe to Fail):** You aren&#x27;t afraid to make mistakes, and you learn from them. You understand that in Ops, breaking things is sometimes part of the process; what matters is how you fix it and prevent it from happening again.</p><p>**Nice-to-Haves:**</p><p>- Experience with n8n, Zapier, or similar automation platforms.
- Experience as an IC in GTM, operations or employee experience roles
- Prior experience in operations, product, hackathons, or building side projects.
- A natural inclination to improve things, if something is inefficient, you want to fix it.</p><p>Not ticking every box? That’s okay. We take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application.</p><p>At Klue, we&#x27;re committed to building a high-performing team where people feel a strong sense of belonging, can be their authentic selves, and are able to reach their full potential. If there’s anything we can do to make our hiring process more accessible or to better support you, please let us know, we’re happy to accommodate.</p><p>## **Why Klue Might Be the Perfect Fit For You**</p><p>At Klue, you’ll push the boundaries of what’s possible. For yourself, your team, and our customers. The environment here feels more startup than corporate. You’ll roll up your sleeves, build, iterate, and level up. This is a place where your ideas matter, you can shape what comes next, and leave your mark.</p><p>If you’re looking to join a category-defining company… where you own big outcomes, influence real customers, and work with smart, gritty people… you’ll thrive here.</p><p>**Unlock Your Potential. Take Risks. Take Action. Innovate**</p><p>## **How We Work at Klue**</p><p>We love the balance of connection and flexibility. We work **Office-First**, with ahybrid touch, and work together in our vibrant offices on **Mondays, Wednesdays &amp; Thursdays** to collaborate, brainstorm, and build together.</p><p>Our main hiring hubs are in:</p><p>- **Vancouver (HQ)**
- **Toronto**
- **London**</p><p>## **Our Commitment to You**</p><p>- **High Performance Culture.** We reward high performance and growth through career development, coaching, and annual performance reviews.
- **Comprehensive benefits:** Extended health &amp; dental coverage that starts on Day 1. Fun perks like discounts at Goodlife and Perkopolis are gravy.
- **Ownership:** All full-time employees have the opportunity to participate in our Employee Stock Option Plan.
- **Our Vacation Policy** is *Take The Time You Need.* We just ask that you give notice and don’t leave your team hanging.
- **Top-tier tools.** All employees will receive a Mac (or PC, if that’s your jam) and access to A+ tooling.
- **AI First.** All employees are encouraged to lean into AI to work smarter and faster. Built something cool lately? Show us at our Friday Show, Don’t Tell Meetings.
- **Growth / Leadership.** Direct access to our leadership team, including our CEO, and opportunities to connect with incredible people across the company.
- **Social connection.** There’s no shortage of ways to stay connected and have fun. We get together once a year in Vancouver for a company- wide kickoff. Throughout the year our Hubs hold regular social events.
- **Dog-friendly spaces.** Bring your four-legged friend along in Vancouver or Toronto, as our offices are pup-approved.</p><p>## **About Klue**</p><p>We’re on a mission to help organizations stop losing winnable deals. Klue’s AI agents generate market, competitor, and buyer insights in a unified platform. We ensure it’s trustworthy, automated, and activated across every department, so they have the answers they need to own their market.</p><p>Here’s what makes us tick:</p><p>- **Klue is AI-first at its core.** It’s wired deep into our internal processes and tooling, powering our small but mighty team. It drives Klue’s autonomous agents that handle the heavy lifting for customers: collecting intel, generating insights, and ensuring content is updated and available across departments. Our agents help them scale their impact, stay ahead of the market, and reclaim the time that used to be consumed by manual, repetitive busywork.
- **Competitor Insights.** Klue helps revenue teams win more competitive deals by turning market, competitor, and buyer signals into insights teams can actually use. Our AI analyzes calls, CRM data, and real buyer feedback to give product marketers and sellers a clear picture of what’s happening in their market and why deals are won or lost. We’re a curious, collaborative team building a platform that helps companies compete with confidence, and we’re looking for people who want to do meaningful work alongside others who care about craft and impact.
- **A culture of curiosity, ownership and winning together**. We’re a fast-growing, globally-distributed team based in Vancouver (with hubs like Toronto), scaling quicker than ever. We value people who own their domain, act boldly, stay curious and thrive in a collaborative, high-performance environment.</p><p>**Explore More**</p><p>- Klue Blog

  "title": "AI Ops Intern",
  "description": "# **At** **Klue****, We\u2019re Building the Future of Competitive Intelligence**\n\nThe **AI Ops Intern** supports the day-to-day work of the AI Ops team and is encouraged to think like a builder. You won\u2019t just complete tasks; you\u2019ll spot opportunities, suggest improvements, and take initiative to build small automations that move the business forward. This role is designed for someone who wants to *try things*, experiment, and learn by doing. This is a fixed term position from May - August 2026 and is open to Co-Op program students or recent graduates.\n\nYou\u2019ll partner closely with the AI Ops team, cross-functional stakeholders, and internal \u201cagent owners\u201d to build simple but meaningful automations, run experiments, document workflows, and contribute to the operational backbone of our AI transformation.\n\nThis is a role for someone who\u2019s **entrepreneurial, proactive, curious, and excited to take risks in a safe environment**. You\u2019ll learn how AI systems operate in a real SaaS environment while independently owning pieces of work that actually ship.\n\n## **What\u2019s In It for You?**\n\nYou\u2019ll get exposure to:\n\n- Real AI workflows and the opportunity to use agent-building tools in a real-world environment\n- Operations at scale across GTM, EPD, G&A\n- Automation design, prompt engineering, testing, and QA\n- How to work cross-functionally and gather requirements\n- Documenting and improving systems used across the company\n\nIf you excel in this role, future growth opportunities are an **AI Ops Specialist** or eventually a **GTM AI Ops Manager or Engineer** down the road.\n\n## **What You\u2019ll Do**\n\n- **AI Workflow Development:** Own clearly scoped automation initiatives from start to finish. You\u2019ll translate loosely defined problem statements into effective agents, prompts, and workflows, experimenting with different build approaches and iterating quickly. From drafting and testing to refining and shipping, you\u2019ll take responsibility for delivering small components end-to-end while learning from what doesn\u2019t work.\n- **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Help drive projects forward by being proactive, prepared, and solutions-oriented. You\u2019ll participate in requirement-gathering sessions, independently follow up on open questions, and clearly communicate progress, blockers, and ideas. You\u2019ll look for opportunities to support stakeholders beyond the original scope and assist with testing or data collection without waiting to be asked.\n- **Operational Excellence & Quality Assurance:** Ensure our automations work reliably by owning quality, not just task completion. You\u2019ll design and run test cases independently, flag inconsistencies, investigate root causes, and suggest improvements. You\u2019ll also take initiative to streamline existing workflows, balancing speed with thoughtful execution and knowing when accuracy matters most.\n- **Documentation & Knowledge Management:** Create clarity by documenting and improving how work gets done. You\u2019ll document new workflows and known issues in a way others can immediately use, identify gaps in playbooks and proactively update them. You\u2019ll capture edge cases, propose fixes, and apply an entrepreneurial mindset to knowledge sharing, making confusing processes clearer for everyone who follows.\n\n## **What Success Looks Like**\n\nWe want you to love the role you are in and believe these skills and experiences will help you to be successful! We are looking for someone who:\n\n- Tries new approaches, experiments with ideas, and learns quickly from what doesn\u2019t work.\n- Completes assigned tasks accurately and on time, and proactively seeks out the next problem to solve.\n- Documentation is clear, structured, and easy to follow so others can maintain what you\u2019ve built,\n- Communicates progress proactively and clearly, especially when working independently.\n- Asks thoughtful, clarifying questions up front and then runs independently.\n- Demonstrates growing confidence in AI tools and workflows by taking on slightly harder challenges over time.\n- Contributes to smooth collaboration across teams by stepping in where needed and owning small pieces of work end\u2011to\u2011end..\n\n## **What You Bring**\n\n**Must Haves:**\n\n- **AI Forward:** You\u2019re always asking yourself: how could we do this with AI, and you have personal examples to prove it. Specifically, you have Prompt Engineering or basic scripting experience\n- **Business Mindset:** You\u2019ve got a mindset for growing businesses, and can speak and think about things from a business point of view\n- **Systems Thinking:** You can see the big picture. You understand that changing one step in a data pipeline affects everything downstream. You don't just fix the symptom; you look for the root cause.\n- **Technical Curiosity:** You have a hunger to learn. You don't know everything yet, and that's okay, but you are willing to dive into new tools, error messages, and figure things out on the fly.\n- **Attention to Detail:** You're good at spotting the small stuff and catch errors and inconsistencies early\n- **Solution-Oriented:** You don't just report problems; you bring potential fixes (or at least hypotheses) to the table.\n- **Resilience (Safe to Fail):** You aren't afraid to make mistakes, and you learn from them. You understand that in Ops, breaking things is sometimes part of the process; what matters is how you fix it and prevent it from happening again.\n\n**Nice-to-Haves:**\n\n- Experience with n8n, Zapier, or similar automation platforms.\n- Experience as an IC in GTM, operations or employee experience roles\n- Prior experience in operations, product, hackathons, or building side projects.\n- A natural inclination to improve things, if something is inefficient, you want to fix it.\n\nNot ticking every box? That\u2019s okay. We take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that\u2019s different from what we\u2019ve described, be sure to explain why in your application.\n\nAt Klue, we're committed to building a high-performing team where people feel a strong sense of belonging, can be their authentic selves, and are able to reach their full potential. If there\u2019s anything we can do to make our hiring process more accessible or to better support you, please let us know, we\u2019re happy to accommodate.\n\n## **Why Klue Might Be the Perfect Fit For You**\n\nAt Klue, you\u2019ll push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. For yourself, your team, and our customers. The environment here feels more startup than corporate. You\u2019ll roll up your sleeves, build, iterate, and level up. This is a place where your ideas matter, you can shape what comes next, and leave your mark.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to join a category-defining company\u2026 where you own big outcomes, influence real customers, and work with smart, gritty people\u2026 you\u2019ll thrive here.\n\n**Unlock Your Potential. Take Risks. Take Action. Innovate**\n\n## **How We Work at Klue**\n\nWe love the balance of connection and flexibility. We work **Office-First**, with ahybrid touch, and work together in our vibrant offices on **Mondays, Wednesdays & Thursdays** to collaborate, brainstorm, and build together.\n\nOur main hiring hubs are in:\n\n- **Vancouver (HQ)**\n- **Toronto**\n- **London**\n\n## **Our Commitment to You**\n\n- **High Performance Culture.** We reward high performance and growth through career development, coaching, and annual performance reviews.\n- **Comprehensive benefits:** Extended health & dental coverage that starts on Day 1. Fun perks like discounts at Goodlife and Perkopolis are gravy.\n- **Ownership:** All full-time employees have the opportunity to participate in our Employee Stock Option Plan.\n- **Our Vacation Policy** is *Take The Time You Need.* We just ask that you give notice and don\u2019t leave your team hanging.\n- **Top-tier tools.** All employees will receive a Mac (or PC, if that\u2019s your jam) and access to A+ tooling.\n- **AI First.** All employees are encouraged to lean into AI to work smarter and faster. Built something cool lately? Show us at our Friday Show, Don\u2019t Tell Meetings.\n- **Growth / Leadership.** Direct access to our leadership team, including our CEO, and opportunities to connect with incredible people across the company.\n- **Social connection.** There\u2019s no shortage of ways to stay connected and have fun. We get together once a year in Vancouver for a company- wide kickoff. Throughout the year our Hubs hold regular social events.\n- **Dog-friendly spaces.** Bring your four-legged friend along in Vancouver or Toronto, as our offices are pup-approved.\n\n## **About Klue**\n\nWe\u2019re on a mission to help organizations stop losing winnable deals. Klue\u2019s AI agents generate market, competitor, and buyer insights in a unified platform. We ensure it\u2019s trustworthy, automated, and activated across every department, so they have the answers they need to own their market.\n\nHere\u2019s what makes us tick:\n\n- **Klue is AI-first at its core.** It\u2019s wired deep into our internal processes and tooling, powering our small but mighty team. It drives Klue\u2019s autonomous agents that handle the heavy lifting for customers: collecting intel, generating insights, and ensuring content is updated and available across departments.

Our AI analyzes calls, CRM data, and real buyer feedback to give product marketers and sellers a clear picture of what\u2019s happening in their market and why deals are won or lost. We\u2019re a curious, collaborative team building a platform that helps companies compete with confidence, and we\u2019re looking for people who want to do meaningful work alongside others who care about craft and impact.\n- **A culture of curiosity, ownership and winning together**.
