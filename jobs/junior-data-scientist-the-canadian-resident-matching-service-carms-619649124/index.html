- Significant experience with relational database systems (e.g., Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- Deep understanding of data management concepts associated with designing, building, maintaining, and extending an Enterprise Data Warehouse.
- Use of version control (Git) and test-based development practices should be strongly engrained in your workflow
- Practical experience with any of the following is valued:
- Implementing
  **semantic search and Q&amp;A**
  on documents.
- Computational statistics, particularly
  **resampling techniques**
  .
- **Matching algorithms**
- **Informatica PowerCenter**
