It&#x27;s an invitation to solve real problems in an environment that values rigour, resilience, and self-leadership. If you’re looking for a 9-to-5 with step-by-step instructions, you will not thrive here.</p><p>**You Should Work Here If:**</p><p>- **You thrive in ambiguity:**
  You can self-teach, ask smart questions, and push through friction, not freeze in the absence of instruction.
- **You embrace self-leadership:**
  You take ownership, operate independently, and are hungry to learn by doing (applied research and quick iteration are daily life).
- **You are mission-driven:**
  You are curious about the convergence of architecture, AI, automation, and fabrication.
- **You are accountable:**
  Deadlines are real. You have a &quot;do-what-it-takes&quot; mentality (including working evenings/weekends when deadlines demand it) and deliver with integrity.
- **You crave challenge:**
  You choose the Everest route over a leisurely hike and want to accelerate your learning curve.</p><p>This internship is a proving ground. It’s not easy, but it is rewarding for the right kind of intern. If you want to coast, this won’t be a good fit. But if you want to accelerate your learning curve and grow into a highly capable professional, this might be the most valuable few months of your early career.</p><p>**You Should Not Work Here If:**</p><p>- You struggle with ambiguity or expect constant hand holding.
- You avoid responsibility or blame others.
- You take constructive feedback personally.
- You treat this internship like a university course (where dropping the ball just means a lower &quot;grade&quot;).
- You’re not here for the mission or the craft.</p><p>This internship isn&#x27;t for everyone, and that’s intentional. If you are hesitant to step out of your comfort zone or looking for a 9-to-5 where someone holds your hand and gives you step-by-step instructions, you won’t thrive here. We’re building something ambitious and unconventional, and that demands people who are hungry to learn, who take ownership, and who can operate in ambiguity with curiosity and resilience.</p><p>**Application Details:**</p><p>- **To Apply:**
  Please submit your resume and portfolio.
- **Stand Out:**
  Really want your application to stand out? Tell us why you think you would be a good fit for
  **MASIV&#x27;s unique mission and culture.**

  "title": "Software Engineer Intern (Winter 2026) 8-12 months",
  "description": "**MASIV | Software Engineering Intern | 8-12 months starting Winter 2026 | In-Person only**\n\n**www.mercedesandsingh.com | Calgary, AB |\n*Canadian Citizens and PR holders only***\n\n***Pay starting at $23.50/hour + Performance Raises/Bonuses***\n\nMASIV (est. 2016) is an Architectural Design, Fabrication, and Build company fusing design, technology, and construction to innovate multi-scale products and environments.\n\nWe are Master Builders for the 21st century, rejecting the segregation of traditional disciplines to create a\n**radical synergy**\nbetween architecture, engineering, and computation. We prioritize humanity above all else, using technology to inspire a new generation of AEC.\n\nWe offer a flexible working environment: we expect you to\n**complete your tasks on time**\nand manage your schedule to fit within your ideal work-life balance.\n\n**The Role: Software Engineering Intern**\n\nMASIV is seeking a motivated and enthusiastic Software Engineering Intern for a high-impact, 8-12 month term. You will collaborate with computational architects, engineers, and fabricators to design, develop, and implement software solutions across various AEC (architecture, engineering, construction) projects and initiatives.\n\n- **Impact:**\n  Contribute to the full software development lifecycle: from requirements gathering and design to testing and deployment.\n- **Mentorship:**\n  You will report directly to the\n  **CEO**\n  on a day-to-day basis, with project guidance from Shop and Site Supervisors.\n- **Focus:**\n  Your role will involve coding, debugging, and maintaining software applications in the cutting-edge intersection of construction technology, AR/VR, and AI.\n\n**Core Responsibilities & Tech Stack**\n\nThis is an execution-focused role where you will work independently with minimal supervision, expected to iterate fast and deliver value.\n\n- **Web & Mobile:**\n  React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React Native: Develop front-end website architecture, user interactions, and manage back-end systems.\n- **3D/AR/VR:**\n  Three.js, WebGL, WebGPU, C# (for Unity-based AR/VR tools): Build browser-based CAD tools and C# scripts for real-time visualization and spatial computing.\n- **AEC Automation:**\n  Python, ML (Dataset training/management)\n  **,**\n  BIM software (RevitAPI, Rhino.Compute -\n  *a plus*\n  ): Implement real-time BIM, simulation, and fabrication pipelines. Solve complex problems and debug software applications.\n- **Communication:**\n  Self-management, Clear Communication, Accountability: Communicate ideas, work, and progress clearly in meetings and creative communication outlets. Take responsibility for specific project areas.\n- **Applied Research:**\n  Be willing and open minded to take on research and apply it to company projects.\n\n**Highly Desirable Assets (a \"Plus\")**\n\n- Experience in\n  **Grasshopper**\n  or other AEC-specific Visual Scripting tools.\n- Proficiency in real-time tools like\n  **Touch Designer, Unreal Engine, or Unity**\n  .\n- Research experience in\n  **computational graphics/geometry/fabrication/intelligence**\n  .\n- Experience with\n  **WASM**\n  .\n- Talented with Vibe Coding and LLM's as\n  **assistants**\n  .\n\n**Qualities we Require (Non-Negotiable)**\n\n- Enrollment in or completion of a\n  **Bachelor of Computer Science, Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Digital Engineering**\n  (or related field).\n- Strong foundational skills in\n  **Javascript, Python, HTML/CSS**\n  .\n- 1-3 years of relevant academic or personal experience in computer science, software engineering, or full-stack development.\n- **Portfolio**\n  demonstrating technical projects, out-of-the-box thinking, and stellar taste in UI/UX design.\n- Strong\n  **commitment to the team**\n  ; maintains positive working relationships and embodies the highest levels of ethics and integrity.\n- Strong commitment to\n  **Company Culture**\n  : Sticking to our Employee Handbook is a non-negotiable.\n- You are\n  **Hungry for Knowledge**\n  : You will be provided learning content for the first 2 months of your internship, to be completed concurrently with project development.\n- Be resourceful. Leverage every tool at your disposal \u2014 documentation, forums, LLMs, community threads \u2014 to find answers and move forward.\n- Deadlines are real. Delivering under pressure is part of how we grow and how we serve.\n- Integrity is non-negotiable. Say what you do. Do what you say. Own your commitments with honesty and accountability.\n- This environment isn\u2019t for everyone. But if you\u2019re here to stretch your limits and contribute to something bigger, we\u2019ll invest in you every step of the way.\n- Resilient to coping with conflicting demands\n- Able to manage sensitive and confidential information\n- Flexible attitude\n- **Location Requirement:**\n  In-Person only at our Calgary, AB office.\n\n**Expectations: This is your Proving Ground**\n\n**This is not a traditional internship.**\nIt's an invitation to solve real problems in an environment that values rigour, resilience, and self-leadership. If you\u2019re looking for a 9-to-5 with step-by-step instructions, you will not thrive here.\n\n**You Should Work Here If:**\n\n- **You thrive in ambiguity:**\n  You can self-teach, ask smart questions, and push through friction, not freeze in the absence of instruction.\n- **You embrace self-leadership:**\n  You take ownership, operate independently, and are hungry to learn by doing (applied research and quick iteration are daily life).\n- **You are mission-driven:**\n  You are curious about the convergence of architecture, AI, automation, and fabrication.\n- **You are accountable:**\n  Deadlines are real. You have a \"do-what-it-takes\" mentality (including working evenings/weekends when deadlines demand it) and deliver with integrity.\n- **You crave challenge:**\n  You choose the Everest route over a leisurely hike and want to accelerate your learning curve.\n\nThis internship is a proving ground. It\u2019s not easy, but it is rewarding for the right kind of intern. If you want to coast, this won\u2019t be a good fit. But if you want to accelerate your learning curve and grow into a highly capable professional, this might be the most valuable few months of your early career.\n\n**You Should Not Work Here If:**\n\n- You struggle with ambiguity or expect constant hand holding.\n- You avoid responsibility or blame others.\n- You take constructive feedback personally.\n- You treat this internship like a university course (where dropping the ball just means a lower \"grade\").\n- You\u2019re not here for the mission or the craft.\n\nThis internship isn't for everyone, and that\u2019s intentional. If you are hesitant to step out of your comfort zone or looking for a 9-to-5 where someone holds your hand and gives you step-by-step instructions, you won\u2019t thrive here. We\u2019re building something ambitious and unconventional, and that demands people who are hungry to learn, who take ownership, and who can operate in ambiguity with curiosity and resilience.\n\n**Application Details:**\n\n- **To Apply:**\n  Please submit your resume and portfolio.\n- **Stand Out:**\n  Really want your application to stand out? Tell us why you think you would be a good fit for\n  **MASIV's unique mission and culture.**\n- **Take-Home Test:**\n  Candidates selected for the next stage will be given a take-home test with a\n  **36-hour time limit**\n  . (Your own skills + vibe coding is encouraged.)\n- **Logistics:**\n  Preference will be given to candidates with their own vehicle due to our office location.\n\n**Desirable**\n\nThe above description reflects the core activities of the role but is not intended to be all-inclusive and other duties within the group/department may be required in addition to changes in the emphasis of duties as required from time to time. There is a requirement for the post holder to recognize this and adopt a flexible approach to work. Job descriptions will be reviewed regularly and where necessary revised in accordance with organizational needs. Any major changes will be discussed with the post holder.\n\nMASIV does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or any other legally protected characteristics.\n\nSalary is based on a number of factors including job-related knowledge, skills, experience, and other business and organizational needs. Our compensation package also includes variable compensation in the form of year-end bonuses, and benefits..\n\n**We Put Safety First**\n\nA healthy and safe work environment is non-negotiable. We build a culture of operational and psychological safety through engagement, learning and leadership.\n\n**We Lead With Honesty**\n\nWe speak and act with integrity, clarity and care so people can trust our word and our work. Being honest means we can deliver the best outcomes and consistent results.\n\n**We Are Stronger Together**\n\nSuccess is a team effort. Our inclusive workplace enables our combined expertise, humility and creativity to unlock our greater potential.\n\n**We Are Driven To Do Great Work**\n\nWe built our name on quality. We have a passion for excellence in our work and relationships that honours our businesses and our industry.\n\n**We Create Opportunity**\n\nRooted in a solid foundation, we adapt and grow to face the future. We are committed to elevating each other to chart the best path forward in an evolving world.",
