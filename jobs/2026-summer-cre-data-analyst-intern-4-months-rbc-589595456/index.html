            <p>**Job Description**
**What is the opportunity**
RBC Corporate Real Estate (CRE) is building a modern, data-driven workplace where AI supports better decisions across space, lease, occupancy, and cost management. Our goal is to move beyond static reports to intelligent systems that can analyze CRE data, reason across multiple sources, generate insights, and recommend actions for leaders and employees.
  
  
As an intern, you will have a chance to work at the intersection of advanced analytics, and agentic AI, helping design intelligent agents that sit on top of trusted CRE reports and datasets—turning reports into insights and insights into decisions.
  
  
You’ll work in a practical innovative environment where you can take ideas from “concept” to working proof-of-value with real stakeholders, real constraints (privacy, governance), and real impact. This role offers hands-on exposure to CRE data, executive use cases, and RBC’s approach to responsible, governed AI innovation.
  
  
**What You Will Do**
Build agentic AI prototypes that can plan tasks, call tools, and generate explanations, insights, and recommendations (e.g., “Why did occupancy costs increase?” or “Which buildings have underutilized space?”)
  
  
Design and test agentic/GenAI workflows for CRE use cases
  
  
Work with structured CRE data to define agent inputs/outputs and ensure answers are grounded, auditable, and reproducible
  
  
Build evaluation and quality checks to validate agent responses against BI metrics and known sources of truth
  
  
Support analytics development including – data validation, defining and documenting metrics, translating business questions into analytical designs
  
  
Develop prompt/tool schemas and guardrails to ensure safe, accurate, policy-aligned outputs
  
  
Document and communicate findings through clear write-ups/business cases and lightweight demos for CRE stakeholders
  
  
Continuously learn and keep up with the latest advancements in AI and related technologies and sharing that knowledge with the team
  
  
**What You Need To Succeed**
**Must Have**
Hands-on experience with Python (data handling, APIs, building prototypes)
  
  
Strong understanding and working knowledge of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms
  
  
Strong understanding and working knowledge of LLMs and GenAI concepts, including prompt engineering, retrieval (RAG), function/tool calling, and structured outputs, prototyping GenAI applications, and vector databases (Weaviate,pgvector)
  
  
Familiarity with agentic patterns and implementation (planning + execution, multi-step reasoning, tool orchestration) and a desire to experiment and learn quickly
  
  
Ability to translate ambiguous business problems into technical approaches, and communicate trade-offs clearly
  
  
Strong analytics fundamentals, including: SQL proficiency
  
  
Understanding of KPIs, metrics, and variance analysis
  
  
Experience working with structured enterprise data
  
  
Data Modeling
  
  
Curiosity, ownership, and comfort working with real-world constraints (data quality, security, stakeholder needs)
  
  
Strong logical thinking skills and attention to detail
  
  
Strong communication skills and comfort working with ambiguity
  
  
**Nice to Have**
Working knowledge of embedding model fine-tunings and Model Context Protocol (MCP), LLM performance evaluation
  
  
Experience with agent frameworks (e.g., LangGraph/LangChain, Semantic Kernel, LlamaIndex) or building multi-agent systems
  
  
Knowledge of cloud data platforms (Snowflake, Databricks, DataIku)
  
  
Interest in Corporate Real Estate domains (space, occupancy, workplace experience, leasing, cost drivers)
  
  
UI prototyping experience (simple web apps, dashboards, Streamlit, or similar)
  
  
Familiarity with dashboard storytelling and executive-level insight presentation
  
  
**What’s In It For You**
A chance to work on real agentic and GenAI initiatives inside a renowned enterprise, where your work can influence how leaders make CRE decisions
  
  
Hands-on experience combining BI, analytics, and AI—highly coveted marketable skill set
  
  
Exposure to enterprise-scale CRE data and how analytics supports executive decision-making at RBC
  
  
Exposure to end-to-end delivery: use case definition → data grounding → AI design → evaluation → demo/storytelling
  
  
Mentorship from a team focused on AI strategy, BI, data governance, and practical product outcomes in the CRE domain
  
  
The opportunity to help shape intelligent reports and AI agents used by real business stakeholders
  
  
Gain firsthand insight into RBC’s approach to responsible AI, security, and governance within production-driven innovation
