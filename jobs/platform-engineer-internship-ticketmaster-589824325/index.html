Division: Ticketmaster NA – Festivals &amp; GA (Universe)
  
  
Line Manager: Engineering Manager
  
  
Contract Terms: Between 8-month Term commencing February 2026 working 37.5 hours per week
  
  
**THE TEAM**
Universe is a leader in online ticketing for general admission events. We’re constantly innovating with a focus on attractions and exhibits and are growing our team! We serve some of the biggest names in entertainment across attractions &amp; clubs with operations spanning 15 countries across North America and Europe.
  
  
Our global team of over 60 people, we operate as an independent entity within the larger Ticketmaster/Live Nation family. We set our own roadmap and operate a modern tech stack (i.e., Kubernetes, Docker, Flux and more!), all with the financial backing and resources of a Fortune 500 company. Free concert tickets are a cool perk too!
  
  
**THE INTERNSHIP**
As a Platform Engineer Intern at Universe, you will apply your passion for technology and live experiences as we work together to build a world-class Event Ticketing platform. In this deeply technical position, you’ll evolve our platform systems and level-up your own skillset. You’ll be challenged with the rewarding tasks of understanding our application engineer’s needs, curating a fantastic development experience, and championing our platform to new heights.
  
  
Our clients, who include some of the world’s biggest musicians and most sought-after events, rely on Universe to provide a stable, performant, and reliable solution that can scale quickly to handle unpredictable demand and large volumes of traffic and data. You’ll get your hands dirty writing code, architecting solutions, and contributing directly to these systems. Through continuous deployment, you’ll ship frequently and have a measurable impact on our platform that you can feel proud of.
  
  
**What You Will Be Doing**</p><p>- Working closely with our experienced platform engineers building supporting infrastructure for our application development teams.
- Working with cloud native tools for building and deploying our applications.
- Tackling the goal of improving developer efficiency by decreasing the release software release cycle.</p><p>Universe primarily uses Kubernetes and Google Cloud to host our applications.
  
  
Our primary datastores are MongoDB, Postgres, and Elastic, though we also use BigQuery. We deploy to GCP and manage our systems with Kubernetes and maintain a continuous deployment pipeline that allows us to ship quickly. Hundreds of thousands of people can come to our site vying for thousands of tickets, so we need to scale quickly and intelligently to handle this demand and prevent conflicts.
  
  
**YOU WILL PROBABLY BE A GOOD FIT IF YOU**</p><p>- Are currently enrolled in a post-secondary program that requires participation in a co-op/internship placement as part of the curriculum to graduate.
- Are adaptable and used to working in rapidly changing environments.
- Passionate about technology.
- Effective communicator, written and oral, as this internship will be working closely with people from all over the organization.
- An independent, fast-learning, self-starter who take ownership over solving hard problems.
- Experience with any of the following technologies is a bonus: Linux, Google Cloud, and Docker.</p><p>The agreed upon compensation language to include in a job posting is as follows:
  
  
The expected compensation for this position in British Columbia is:
  
  
$25.00 CAD per hour.</p><p>- Please note that the compensation information provided is a good faith estimate for this position only and is provided pursuant to the British Columbia Pay Transparency Act. It is estimated based on what a successful British Columbia applicant might be paid. It assumes that the successful candidate will be in British Columbia or perform the position from British Columbia. Similar positions located outside of British Columbia will not necessarily receive the same compensation. Live Nation takes into consideration a candidate’s education, training, and experience, as well as the position’s work location, expected quality and quantity of work, required travel (if any), external market and internal value, including seniority and merit systems, and internal pay alignment when determining the salary level for potential new employees. In compliance with the Pay Transparency Act, a potential new employee’s salary history will not be used in compensation decisions.</p><p>**LIFE AT TICKETMASTER**
We are proud to be a part of Live Nation Entertainment, the world’s largest live entertainment company.
  
  
Our vision at Ticketmaster is to connect people around the world to the live events they love.

If you’re passionate about live entertainment like we are, and you want to work at a company dedicated to helping millions of fans experience it, we want to hear from you.
  
  
**Our Work Is Guided By Our Values**
**Reliability**
- We understand that fans and clients rely on us to power their live event experiences, and we rely on each other to make it happen.
  
  
**Teamwork**
- We believe individual achievement pales in comparison to the level of success that can be achieved by a team.
  
  
**Integrity**
- We are committed to the highest moral and ethical standards on behalf of the countless partners and stakeholders we represent.
  
  
**Belonging**
- We are committed to building a culture in which all people can be their authentic selves, have an equal voice and opportunities to thrive.

We\u2019re constantly innovating with a focus on attractions and exhibits and are growing our team! We serve some of the biggest names in entertainment across attractions & clubs with operations spanning 15 countries across North America and Europe.\n  \n  \nOur global team of over 60 people, we operate as an independent entity within the larger Ticketmaster/Live Nation family. We set our own roadmap and operate a modern tech stack (i.e., Kubernetes, Docker, Flux and more!), all with the financial backing and resources of a Fortune 500 company. Free concert tickets are a cool perk too!\n  \n  \n**THE INTERNSHIP**\nAs a Platform Engineer Intern at Universe, you will apply your passion for technology and live experiences as we work together to build a world-class Event Ticketing platform. In this deeply technical position, you\u2019ll evolve our platform systems and level-up your own skillset. You\u2019ll be challenged with the rewarding tasks of understanding our application engineer\u2019s needs, curating a fantastic development experience, and championing our platform to new heights.\n  \n  \nOur clients, who include some of the world\u2019s biggest musicians and most sought-after events, rely on Universe to provide a stable, performant, and reliable solution that can scale quickly to handle unpredictable demand and large volumes of traffic and data. You\u2019ll get your hands dirty writing code, architecting solutions, and contributing directly to these systems. Through continuous deployment, you\u2019ll ship frequently and have a measurable impact on our platform that you can feel proud of.\n  \n  \n**What You Will Be Doing**\n\n- Working closely with our experienced platform engineers building supporting infrastructure for our application development teams.\n- Working with cloud native tools for building and deploying our applications.\n- Tackling the goal of improving developer efficiency by decreasing the release software release cycle.\n\nUniverse primarily uses Kubernetes and Google Cloud to host our applications.\n  \n  \nOur primary datastores are MongoDB, Postgres, and Elastic, though we also use BigQuery. We deploy to GCP and manage our systems with Kubernetes and maintain a continuous deployment pipeline that allows us to ship quickly. Hundreds of thousands of people can come to our site vying for thousands of tickets, so we need to scale quickly and intelligently to handle this demand and prevent conflicts.\n  \n  \n**YOU WILL PROBABLY BE A GOOD FIT IF YOU**\n\n- Are currently enrolled in a post-secondary program that requires participation in a co-op/internship placement as part of the curriculum to graduate.\n- Are adaptable and used to working in rapidly changing environments.\n- Passionate about technology.\n- Effective communicator, written and oral, as this internship will be working closely with people from all over the organization.\n- An independent, fast-learning, self-starter who take ownership over solving hard problems.\n- Experience with any of the following technologies is a bonus: Linux, Google Cloud, and Docker.\n\nThe agreed upon compensation language to include in a job posting is as follows:\n  \n  \nThe expected compensation for this position in British Columbia is:\n  \n  \n$25.00 CAD per hour.\n  \n  \n\n- Please note that the compensation information provided is a good faith estimate for this position only and is provided pursuant to the British Columbia Pay Transparency Act. It is estimated based on what a successful British Columbia applicant might be paid. It assumes that the successful candidate will be in British Columbia or perform the position from British Columbia. Similar positions located outside of British Columbia will not necessarily receive the same compensation. Live Nation takes into consideration a candidate\u2019s education, training, and experience, as well as the position\u2019s work location, expected quality and quantity of work, required travel (if any), external market and internal value, including seniority and merit systems, and internal pay alignment when determining the salary level for potential new employees. In compliance with the Pay Transparency Act, a potential new employee\u2019s salary history will not be used in compensation decisions.\n\n**LIFE AT TICKETMASTER**\nWe are proud to be a part of Live Nation Entertainment, the world\u2019s largest live entertainment company.\n  \n  \nOur vision at Ticketmaster is to connect people around the world to the live events they love. As the world\u2019s largest ticket marketplace and the leading global provider of enterprise tools and services for the live entertainment business, we are uniquely positioned to successfully deliver on that vision.\n  \n  \nWe do it all with an intense passion for Live and an inspiring and diverse culture driven by accessible leaders, attentive managers, and enthusiastic teams. If you\u2019re passionate about live entertainment like we are, and you want to work at a company dedicated to helping millions of fans experience it, we want to hear from you.\n  \n  \n**Our Work Is Guided By Our Values**\n**Reliability**\n- We understand that fans and clients rely on us to power their live event experiences, and we rely on each other to make it happen.\n  \n  \n**Teamwork**\n- We believe individual achievement pales in comparison to the level of success that can be achieved by a team.\n  \n  \n**Integrity**\n- We are committed to the highest moral and ethical standards on behalf of the countless partners and stakeholders we represent.\n  \n  \n**Belonging**\n- We are committed to building a culture in which all people can be their authentic selves, have an equal voice and opportunities to thrive.\n  \n  \n**EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES**\nWe are passionate and committed to our people and go beyond the rhetoric of diversity and inclusion. You will be working in an inclusive environment and be encouraged to bring your whole self to work. We will do all that we can to help you successfully balance your work and homelife. As a growing business we will encourage you to develop your professional and personal aspirations, enjoy new experiences, and learn from the talented people you will be working with. It's talent that matters to us and we encourage applications from people irrespective of their gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability status or caring responsibilities.\n  \n  \nTicketmaster Canada will provide reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities in the job application process. If you have difficulty using our online application system and need an accommodation due to a disability, please email accessibilitycanada@ticketmaster.ca. Please note this inbox is limited to accommodation requests.
