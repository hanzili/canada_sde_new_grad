            <p>*Build bold. Deliver impact. Win together.*
At General Dynamics Mission Systems–Canada, we’re not just engineering technology — we’re shaping the future of defence and security. Our teams design and deliver advanced, mission-critical solutions that enhance national security, strengthen communities, and protect the people we serve.
  
  
If you’re looking for meaningful work that contributes to a safer, more secure world, you’ll find purpose here. Every day, your skills will directly impact programs that matter.
  
  
**Job Description**
The GDMS-C Advanced Vetronics Systems division is looking for
**multiple**

**May 2026**
.
  
  
This multi-disciplinary team develops electronics systems for armored tactical vehicles. These systems include in-vehicle video management, smart displays, fire control, ballistics computing, and vehicle control. We develop products in-house, including the mechanical systems, power supplies, circuit boards, optics, FPGAs and software.
  
  
As part of a project team, you will be working with highly complex circuit cards for military applications as they are brought into full-rate production. This involves engineering analysis at all levels; from the detailed electrical characterization of individual circuits, right up to the full lifecycle management of a card as it goes through engineering development and into full-rate production. Designs you will be working with include high-density interconnect PCBs with high-speed FPGA SoCs, multi-channel memory interfaces and multi-gigabit peripherals.
  
  
Expect to be working with smart, talented people like you. Every project is different, and every project presents new challenges to learn and grow. As a junior electrical engineer, you will be mentored by experienced electrical engineers, which will lead to you eventually taking on design authority and schematic capture of your own cards in Siemens DX Designer in the 2-3 year timeframe (if that is a career goal).
  
  
**In this role you may...**</p><p>- Support new product introduction activities that include the first power-up of newly designed circuit cards (bring-up), detailed design characterization of those cards, and then long-term engineering support of the encompassing product.
- Simulate (LTSpice) and test circuits and electrical solutions using various circuit analysis techniques.
- Design circuits in Siemens DX Designer (future, 2-3 year timeframe)
- Develop new test approaches to meet the growing needs of new product development.
- Execute and document various engineering investigations, leading to root cause and corrective action processes (RCCA)
- Perform component selection analysis for obsolescence mitigations and new developments.
- Advise factory technicians / technologists as they perform testing / debug of the assembled circuit cards.</p><p>**Qualifications**
**Required Qualifications**</p><p>- Bachelor’s degree program in Electrical Engineering or equivalent from an accredited university is required.
- Work experience as a student in an engineering professional engineering environment is an asset.
- Being a licensed Professional Engineer (P.Eng.) is not a requirement, however candidates working towards that goal will be able to have their work experience validated by one of our Professional Engineers in support of their license application.</p><p>**Essential Skills**</p><p>- Strong understanding of computer systems, from low level hardware to OS applications.

- Ability to understand and interpret schematic diagrams, drawings, parts lists, bills of materials.
- Ability to interpret and verify requirements.
- Good understanding of circuit simulation and associated limitations.
- Ability to effectively multi-task, prioritize and schedule tasks to meet project goals, and work in a time-critical environment.</p><p>**Experience with any of the following is an asset:**</p><p>- Circuit card schematic design.
- Power supply design.
- High-speed circuit design.
- Analog and digital control systems.
- Ethernet network installations.
- University-level courses in Digital Circuits and Systems, Digital Computer Architectures, Digital Signal Processing, Analog Circuits, Power Electronics</p><p>**How We Work**</p><p>- Work Schedule: 37.5 hours per week - flexible within core business hours.
- Work Arrangement: Potential mix of onsite and remote work, as determined by business and role requirements.</p><p>It is a requirement that General Dynamics Mission Systems-Canada be registered with the Canadian Controlled Goods program and that all of its workforce be security assessed.
