Electronic Arts creates next-level entertainment experiences that inspire players and fans around the world. Here, everyone is part of the story. Part of a community that connects across the globe. A place where creativity thrives, new perspectives are invited, and ideas matter. A team where everyone makes play happen.
  
  
Electronic Arts is looking for students to join our world-class internship experience. For more information about our Emerging Talent Program, visit https://www.ea.com/careers/interns-and-university-graduates
  
  
We are EA
  
  
And we make games – how cool is that? In fact, we entertain millions of people across the globe with the most amazing and immersive interactive software in the industry. But making games is hard work. That’s why we employ the most creative, passionate people in the industry.
  
  
The Challenge Ahead
  
  
The Game Developer Experience (GDX) organization exists to improve the day-to-day experience of our game developers by creating tools and platforms that increase productivity, reduce friction, and streamline the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). As part of this mission, our team focuses on applying modern technologies — including Generative AI — to solve real problems faced by developers building EA’s games.
  
  
This internship is a technical role that offers hands-on experience designing and building developer-facing tools that enable efficiency at scale. You will help explore, prototype, and implement AI-enabled solutions that integrate deeply into existing development workflows and tools such as Perforce, GitLab, JIRA, and Slack. One example of the team’s work includes building an AI-assisted code review capability for Perforce, addressing a gap where no off-the-shelf solution currently exists.
  
  
You will work closely with game teams and central technology groups to understand developer pain points and translate them into practical, scalable solutions. These tools are built with a cloud-first mindset and leverage public cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, along with modern automation and integration patterns.
  
  
Throughout the internship, you will gain exposure to the full lifecycle of developer tooling — from problem discovery and technical design to implementation and iteration — while collaborating with experienced engineers in an agile environment. Your work will directly contribute to improving how EA’s game developers build, review, test, and ship games.
