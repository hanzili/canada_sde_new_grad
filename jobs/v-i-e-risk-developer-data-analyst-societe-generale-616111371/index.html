**Responsibilities**
The RISQ Division&#x27;s mission is to contribute to the sustainable and predictable growth of the SG Group by overseeing and independently challenging the objectives and strategies of the Business Lines. RISQ’s mission is to independently analyze, challenge, opine and monitor on the risk-taking activities of the Business Lines in order to get to the best possible outcome for the Bank. The RISQ division in the US supports all the activities in the Americas Region (US, Canada and Latin America), which is almost exclusively SGCIB-oriented.
  
  
Within the RISQ Division, the Operational Risk (“RISQ/AME/NFR”) department has the primary responsibility as the Second Line of Defense (“2LOD”) for developing, enforcing and overseeing the Operational Risk Framework based on SG Group, Regulator and peer best practices. The mission is to manage the operational risks and permanent control frameworks to which SG’s Americas operations (SG AMER) are exposed.

- Providing guidance and advice to the lines of business on a day-to-day basis to pre-emptively identify, manage and mitigate operational risk throughout SG AMER
- Evaluating and escalating critical and emerging risks across the firm and to the Group level organization, and ensure proper controls are implemented
- Aggregating risks and information across SG AMER; ensuring escalation of non-compliance of risk limits and standards through SG AMER governance and reporting structure</p><p>Fraud Risk Management within RISQ/NFR/AMER is the process of assessing fraud risks within the organization and then identifying potential and inherent fraud risks and developing a program that works to detect and prevent suspected fraud, both internal and external to the business.

- Participate in projects particularly focused on the automation enhancements of fraud risk management reporting and metric production by working with IT (develop red flag reports, dashboards, and management reports)
- Maintain the current fraud monitoring framework
- Develop new indicators to detect fraudulent / suspicious activity
- Review external events and identify ways to spread fraud awareness throughout the organization
- Collaborate with our colleagues in the other regions (UK, Paris, Asia)
- Review key risk indicators and perform investigations</p><p>**A questionnaire will be provided to you in order to check your VIE (Société Générale and Business France) eligibility. For an efficient analysis of your application, please make sure to truthfully answer all the questions.**
