**Department:**
Government of Nova Scotia
  
  
**Location:**
Flexible
  
  
**Type of Employment:**
Student
  
  
**Union Status:**
Exclusion - Non Union - NSPG
  
  
**Closing Date:**
31-Jul-26 (Applications are accepted until 11:59 PM Atlantic Time)
  
  
**About Us**
At the
**Nova Scotia Provincial Government**
, we recognize the value students bring—
**fresh perspectives, new ideas, and curiosity that help shape the future of public service.**
Whether you’re still exploring career paths or starting to build professional experience, your contributions matter.
  
  
Students work across a wide range of programs and services that support communities throughout Nova Scotia. Along the way, you’ll have opportunities to learn, grow, and see how your skills make a real‑world impact.
  
  
We are committed to fostering a culture of
**belonging, respect, and inclusion.**
Diverse perspectives and lived experiences strengthen our work, and we strive to create an environment where students feel welcomed, supported, and empowered to bring their whole selves to work.
  
  
We encourage applications from students who share our commitment to
**equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (EDIA)**
and who want to be part of a public service that reflects the communities it serves.
  
  
**One Application, Many Opportunities**
This competition is part of the
**Future Opportunities Stream for Students**
—a centralized intake that allows you to submit
**one application**
to be considered for
**multiple student opportunities across government**
. By applying once, you join a talent pool of students with diverse skills, interests, and experiences who may be matched to roles as positions become available.
  
  
Through this stream, students may be considered for opportunities focused on
**business and professional functions**
, including,
**HR, Finance, Accounting**
, as well as other related business support and corporate services areas. These roles support the operation and delivery of government programs and services and may be available across a range of departments, agencies, and initiatives. Matches are based on operational needs as well as how your skills and interests align with available positions.
  
  
These opportunities are designed with students in mind. Positions are temporary and offer meaningful, hands‑on work experience that supports skill development, applied learning, and career exploration in professional and business environments.
  
  
**Work close to home—or somewhere new.**
Opportunities may be available in multiple locations across Nova Scotia, depending on operational needs and student interest, including hybrid or technology‑enabled work environments where applicable.
  
  
As part of the application process, you will complete a series of pre‑screening questions to help us better understand your skills, strengths, and interests. Not all skills are required for every role—some may be considered assets rather than essential, depending on the position. While there are several questions, they are straightforward and should not take long to complete. Thoughtful responses help us match students with the most suitable opportunities.
  
  
**Equity matters.**
Some roles may be designated for specific employment equity groups. To be considered for these opportunities, applicants must self‑identify during the application process.
  
  
Learn more by reviewing the Nova Scotia Government’s Employment Equity Policy, including details on designated groups.
  
  
**Apply once—and access a range of business and professional opportunities. Take the next step in your student career journey in corporate services and business disciplines.**
