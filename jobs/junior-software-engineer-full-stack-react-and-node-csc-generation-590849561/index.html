        <h2>Full Description</h2>
        <div class="description-content" itemprop="description">
            <p>CSC Generation is a technology driven holding company that acquires and operates established consumer brands, including One Kings Lane, Backcountry, and Sur La Table. Across 13 brands generating over $1B in annual revenue, we improve how these businesses run by building shared platforms, automation, and data tooling that scale across the portfolio.</p><p>This role is platform work at the intersection of e-commerce, operations, and data. You will ship production changes used daily, and you will learn reliable delivery through small pull requests, code review, and disciplined debugging.</p><p>This Junior Software Engineer role is for early career full-stack engineers who want to grow quickly. You will work primarily in JavaScript and TypeScript, with React on the front end and Node on the back end, and over time you will own small features end to end.</p><p>### **What you get to do:**</p><p>- Build and refine user facing features using React, TypeScript, and modern front end tooling.
- Implement and integrate simple backend services using Node and TypeScript or JavaScript, including REST style APIs and basic data models.
- Work with senior engineers to break down requirements into small, shippable pieces and implement them end to end.
- Write clear, maintainable code and basic tests for both front end and back endfunctionality.
- Collaborate with product and design to polish UX details, handle edge cases, and improve performance and reliability.
- Use AI assisted tools, such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, in a disciplined way to speed up development while keeping code quality high.
- Participate in code reviews, ask questions, and steadily grow toward owning small features and services independently.
- Practice good engineering hygiene: version control, small pull requests, clear commit messages, and lightweight documentation.
- Invest in your own growth: read documentation, keep notes, and reflect on feedback you receive.</p><p>### **What you bring:**</p><p>- You do not need to check every box. We are open to candidates who are early in their careers but show strong fundamentals and learning habits.
- Experience with JavaScript or TypeScript through coursework, internships, personal projects, bootcamps, or 0 to 3 years of professional work.
- Some hands-on experience with React and component based UI development, including state management and basic forms.
- Some exposure to backend development in Node, for example simple APIs, scripts, or server side logic.
- Comfort with HTML and CSS, responsive layouts, and common web patterns.
- Basic understanding of HTTP, JSON, and how front end code communicates with backend services.
- Some exposure to testing tools on either front end or back end, or a clear willingness to learn them.
- Strong debugging mindset: you read error messages, check logs, and try small experiments before asking for help.
- Evidence of being studious and self directed. For example:
- You maintain personal notes or a knowledge base.
- You can describe something difficult you taught yourself recently and how you went about it.
- Clear communication, willingness to receive feedback, and a growth mindset.</p><p>**Nice to have**</p><p>- Experience with a web framework such as Express, Next.js, or similar.
- Exposure to databases or data storage, even if only in simple projects.
- Awareness of accessibility, performance, and basic security considerations.
- Prior use of AI coding assistants or strong interest in using them responsibly in your workflow.
- Experience with ecommerce, design systems, or component libraries.</p><p>### **How we hire for this role:**</p><p>- We use two small, focused exercises as part of the process:
- A front end React and TypeScript exercise that looks like a real feature you might ship.
- A simple backend Node exercise that tests API and data modeling fundamentals.</p><p>**We look for:**</p><p>- Clear, readable code and correct behavior for the core requirements.
- A methodical approach to state and data, not clever tricks.
- Evidence that you read the specification carefully and handle edge cases thoughtfully.
- Perfect completion is not required. We care a lot about:
- How you approach problems when you are uncertain.
- Whether you leave comments or notes when you run out of time.
- How you explain your decisions and describe what you would improve with more time.
- Later stages focus on how you debug in real time, how you respond to feedback, and how you work with frustration and ambiguity without shutting down.</p><p>### **What&#x27;s in it for you:**</p><p>- This role is designed to turn early career engineers into reliable full stack contributors through real production work and tight feedback loops. You will ship user-facing features, contribute to backend services, and learn the day to day engineering habits that matter most: scoping work into small increments, writing readable code, reviewing code thoughtfully, and debugging issues end to end.</p><p>- Within your first 6 months, you will ship production changes and take ownership of clearly scoped features with light guidance through code review. Diligent engineers in this role often move faster, owning larger features earlier than is typical for junior roles, because we favor small teams, fast iteration, and real responsibility. The pace is real, and support is there when you need it, but you are expected to drive.</p><p>In addition to competitive compensation, we offer:</p><p>- **Executive Access:** Direct access to decision makers so good ideas do not get stuck in long approval chains, and so your work can ship faster.
- **AI-First Skill Building:** Hands on experience using AI-assisted development tools with the same expectations we have for any code: reviewable, testable, and maintainable.
- **Career Growth:** Increasing scope and ownership based on demonstrated readiness, including opportunities to expand across frontend and backend work as you develop.
- **Competitive benefits:** Paid time off policies, 401(k)/RRSP match, medical, dental, vision, supplemental policies, and employee discounts at our portfolio companies.</p><p>The CSC family of brands provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, provincial, state or local laws.</p><p>The CSC family of brands is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities in our job application procedures.

  "title": "Junior Software Engineer (Full Stack, React and Node)",
  "description": "CSC Generation is a technology driven holding company that acquires and operates established consumer brands, including One Kings Lane, Backcountry, and Sur La Table. Across 13 brands generating over $1B in annual revenue, we improve how these businesses run by building shared platforms, automation, and data tooling that scale across the portfolio.\n\nThis role is platform work at the intersection of e-commerce, operations, and data. You will ship production changes used daily, and you will learn reliable delivery through small pull requests, code review, and disciplined debugging.\n\nThis Junior Software Engineer role is for early career full-stack engineers who want to grow quickly. You will work primarily in JavaScript and TypeScript, with React on the front end and Node on the back end, and over time you will own small features end to end.\n\n### **What you get to do:**\n\n- Build and refine user facing features using React, TypeScript, and modern front end tooling.\n- Implement and integrate simple backend services using Node and TypeScript or JavaScript, including REST style APIs and basic data models.\n- Work with senior engineers to break down requirements into small, shippable pieces and implement them end to end.\n- Write clear, maintainable code and basic tests for both front end and back endfunctionality.\n- Collaborate with product and design to polish UX details, handle edge cases, and improve performance and reliability.\n- Use AI assisted tools, such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, in a disciplined way to speed up development while keeping code quality high.\n- Participate in code reviews, ask questions, and steadily grow toward owning small features and services independently.\n- Practice good engineering hygiene: version control, small pull requests, clear commit messages, and lightweight documentation.\n- Invest in your own growth: read documentation, keep notes, and reflect on feedback you receive.\n\n### **What you bring:**\n\n- You do not need to check every box. We are open to candidates who are early in their careers but show strong fundamentals and learning habits.\n- Experience with JavaScript or TypeScript through coursework, internships, personal projects, bootcamps, or 0 to 3 years of professional work.\n- Some hands-on experience with React and component based UI development, including state management and basic forms.\n- Some exposure to backend development in Node, for example simple APIs, scripts, or server side logic.\n- Comfort with HTML and CSS, responsive layouts, and common web patterns.\n- Basic understanding of HTTP, JSON, and how front end code communicates with backend services.\n- Some exposure to testing tools on either front end or back end, or a clear willingness to learn them.\n- Strong debugging mindset: you read error messages, check logs, and try small experiments before asking for help.\n- Evidence of being studious and self directed. For example:\n- You maintain personal notes or a knowledge base.\n- You can describe something difficult you taught yourself recently and how you went about it.\n- Clear communication, willingness to receive feedback, and a growth mindset.\n\n**Nice to have**\n\n- Experience with a web framework such as Express, Next.js, or similar.\n- Exposure to databases or data storage, even if only in simple projects.\n- Awareness of accessibility, performance, and basic security considerations.\n- Prior use of AI coding assistants or strong interest in using them responsibly in your workflow.\n- Experience with ecommerce, design systems, or component libraries.\n\n### **How we hire for this role:**\n\n- We use two small, focused exercises as part of the process:\n- A front end React and TypeScript exercise that looks like a real feature you might ship.\n- A simple backend Node exercise that tests API and data modeling fundamentals.\n\n**We look for:**\n\n- Clear, readable code and correct behavior for the core requirements.\n- A methodical approach to state and data, not clever tricks.\n- Evidence that you read the specification carefully and handle edge cases thoughtfully.\n- Perfect completion is not required. We care a lot about:\n- How you approach problems when you are uncertain.\n- Whether you leave comments or notes when you run out of time.\n- How you explain your decisions and describe what you would improve with more time.\n- Later stages focus on how you debug in real time, how you respond to feedback, and how you work with frustration and ambiguity without shutting down.\n\n### **What's in it for you:**\n\n- This role is designed to turn early career engineers into reliable full stack contributors through real production work and tight feedback loops. You will ship user-facing features, contribute to backend services, and learn the day to day engineering habits that matter most: scoping work into small increments, writing readable code, reviewing code thoughtfully, and debugging issues end to end.\n\n- Within your first 6 months, you will ship production changes and take ownership of clearly scoped features with light guidance through code review. Diligent engineers in this role often move faster, owning larger features earlier than is typical for junior roles, because we favor small teams, fast iteration, and real responsibility. The pace is real, and support is there when you need it, but you are expected to drive.\n\nIn addition to competitive compensation, we offer:\n\n- **Executive Access:** Direct access to decision makers so good ideas do not get stuck in long approval chains, and so your work can ship faster.\n- **AI-First Skill Building:** Hands on experience using AI-assisted development tools with the same expectations we have for any code: reviewable, testable, and maintainable.\n- **Career Growth:** Increasing scope and ownership based on demonstrated readiness, including opportunities to expand across frontend and backend work as you develop.\n- **Competitive benefits:** Paid time off policies, 401(k)/RRSP match, medical, dental, vision, supplemental policies, and employee discounts at our portfolio companies.\n\nThe CSC family of brands provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, provincial, state or local laws.\n\nThe CSC family of brands is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please contact hrbenefits@cscshared.com\n\nWe may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.
