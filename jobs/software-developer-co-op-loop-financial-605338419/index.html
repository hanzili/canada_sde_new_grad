**“Interning at Loop isn’t your average internship - from your first day, you’re treated like a full member of the team. You’ll ship real features, work across the stack, and get hands-on with the newest AI tools. The fast-paced, startup environment means you’ll learn quickly, take ownership early, and see your work make an impact (even on day one). The growing, collaborative team is tight-knit, kind, and always happy to answer questions and help any way they can. You won’t just grow as an engineer - you’ll get to learn about how all aspects of a company come together” - Simon, Queen’s University**
**“Being a software developer intern at Loop embodies what working at a fast-paced start up is like, learning quickly, having ownership, and actually contributing. From day one you are treated as a junior developer with responsibilities and high impact tasks, so don’t expect to be grabbing coffees and just scrolling through your calendar trying to look busy! At Loop you are working with a collaborative team that’s passionate about the product and happy to answer/help with any questions you have, not just about engineering but anything you’re curious about. I think at Loop you can learn 10x more than any corporate co-op role, being involved in and gaining insights on how every facet of how a company operates from ideation to shipping.” - Anson, Western University**
**“**
**My experience at Loop has been an incredibly rewarding, fulfilling, and challenging experience. From my first week at the company until now I have been contributing to the company in truly meaningful and impactful ways. I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to work on and even lead projects crucial to the company&#x27;s success which is something I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to say I did at any other company as an intern. The environment at Loop is incredible, everyone is very friendly, kind, and extremely helpful. They make every day at work something to look forward to. Being an intern at Loop doesn&#x27;t feel like an internship at all, it feels like you&#x27;re a senior engineer which is honestly the best thing I could say about an internship. Be prepared to work hard and have an experience like no other working here!” - Peyton, University of British Columbia**
**“My time at Loop has been one of the most enjoyable, educational, and rewarding experiences of my life. As a startup, Loop threw me right into the action from day one, trusting me with projects that had real impact and significance. That level of trust and responsibility helped me grow fast and stay motivated. What really sets Loop apart is the culture. Everyone here is kind, open, and genuinely eager to help. Whether I had a technical question or just wanted to understand the bigger picture, people always made time for me. And beyond the work, we’ve had no shortage of fun conversations—especially over lunch. It’s rare to wake up genuinely excited to go to work, but the atmosphere at Loop made that possible. We’re building a financial system that’s truly one-of-a-kind and has the potential to help people around the world. I’m incredibly proud to say I’ve been a part of that, and truly think that anybody is very lucky to have the opportunity to work here.” - Dylan, Queen’s University**

You\u2019ll ship real features, work across the stack, and get hands-on with the newest AI tools. The fast-paced, startup environment means you\u2019ll learn quickly, take ownership early, and see your work make an impact (even on day one). The growing, collaborative team is tight-knit, kind, and always happy to answer questions and help any way they can. You won\u2019t just grow as an engineer - you\u2019ll get to learn about how all aspects of a company come together\u201d - Simon, Queen\u2019s University**\n**\u201cBeing a software developer intern at Loop embodies what working at a fast-paced start up is like, learning quickly, having ownership, and actually contributing. From day one you are treated as a junior developer with responsibilities and high impact tasks, so don\u2019t expect to be grabbing coffees and just scrolling through your calendar trying to look busy! At Loop you are working with a collaborative team that\u2019s passionate about the product and happy to answer/help with any questions you have, not just about engineering but anything you\u2019re curious about.

From my first week at the company until now I have been contributing to the company in truly meaningful and impactful ways. I've had the opportunity to work on and even lead projects crucial to the company's success which is something I don't think I'd be able to say I did at any other company as an intern. The environment at Loop is incredible, everyone is very friendly, kind, and extremely helpful. They make every day at work something to look forward to. Being an intern at Loop doesn't feel like an internship at all, it feels like you're a senior engineer which is honestly the best thing I could say about an internship. Be prepared to work hard and have an experience like no other working here!\u201d - Peyton, University of British Columbia**\n**\u201cMy time at Loop has been one of the most enjoyable, educational, and rewarding experiences of my life.

That level of trust and responsibility helped me grow fast and stay motivated. What really sets Loop apart is the culture. Everyone here is kind, open, and genuinely eager to help. Whether I had a technical question or just wanted to understand the bigger picture, people always made time for me. And beyond the work, we\u2019ve had no shortage of fun conversations\u2014especially over lunch. It\u2019s rare to wake up genuinely excited to go to work, but the atmosphere at Loop made that possible. We\u2019re building a financial system that\u2019s truly one-of-a-kind and has the potential to help people around the world. I\u2019m incredibly proud to say I\u2019ve been a part of that, and truly think that anybody is very lucky to have the opportunity to work here.\u201d - Dylan, Queen\u2019s University**\n****Our Tech Stack****\n\n- Language/Framework\n\n\n- Ruby on Rails for our Backend API & Internal Team Admin\n- React (Javascript and TypeScript) for our Customer Facing Application\n\n- Database\n\n\n- Postgres\n\n- Server\n\n\n- Backend is hosted in Heroku\n- Front-end on Netlify\n- Underwriting module on AWS\n\n**What We Offer**\n\n- Salary range CAD$25-35/hour, commensurate with experience\n- This role is onsite in our downtown Toronto office\n- Kitchen full of snacks and drinks to keep you going throughout the day\n- Catered lunch on Fridays (we take recommendations!)\n\n****Interview Process****\n\n- 30 minutes video call to discuss the opportunity and the organization with Mandy, People and Business Operations Specialist\n- 30 minutes video call to discuss the opportunity and the organization with Yan, Head of Engineering\n- 30 minutes video call to discuss the opportunity and technical ability (no coding exercise) with Ryan, Engineering Manager\n- 60 minutes (ideally) in person coding exercise with 2 team members\n- 30 minutes (in person or virtual) meeting with Cato, CEO and Co-Founder and 15 minutes with Sarah, Chief of Staff\n- Background check and offer\n\n****Our Mission, Vision and Values****\n\n- Mission: To help businesses seamlessly manage money around the world so they can access more markets, save money and simplify their operations\n- Vision: The future of business is global by default.
