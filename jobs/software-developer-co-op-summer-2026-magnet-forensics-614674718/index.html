At Magnet Forensics, we take a hybrid-flexible approach to support your productivity and work-life balance.

Most days, you can choose what works best for you, while staying in tune with your team’s goals.
  
  
We’re excited to welcome you to our team and look forward to achieving great things together - both in the office and wherever you work best!
